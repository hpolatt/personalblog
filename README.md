# .NET MVC Project

## Introduction

This project is a .NET MVC application. It uses various technologies and design patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and robustness.

## Technologies Used

In this project, the following technologies and tools are used:

- **ASP.NET MVC**: For building the web application using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For data access and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **SQL Server**: As the database management system.
- **Identity Framework**: For authentication and authorization.
- **AutoMapper**: For object-to-object mapping.
- **Dependency Injection**: For managing dependencies and promoting loose coupling.
- **Razor Pages**: For dynamic web page generation.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and modern UI design.
- **jQuery**: For client-side scripting and AJAX calls.
- **JavaScript**: For additional client-side functionality.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JSON**: For data interchange format.
- **Git**: For version control.

## Design Patterns Used

In this project, the following design patterns are used:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Pattern**: Provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Project**: Open the project in your favorite IDE.
3. **Restore Dependencies**: Restore the project dependencies using NuGet.
4. **Update Database**: Apply migrations to update the database schema.
5. **Run the Project**: Build and run the project to see the application in action.

## Conclusion

This .NET MVC project leverages various technologies and design patterns to create a robust, maintainable, and scalable web application. By understanding and using these technologies and patterns, you can improve the quality of your code and make your development process more efficient.
